# A proof-of-concept system for the procedural animation of affective facial expression
# Ostensibly based on outputs of the Heriot Watt ISL's FAtiMA agent, itself derived from
# the OCC model.
# 
# This will mostly be C# code, for use within Unity.
# Documentation may or may not be kept up to date on the gitHub wiki for this project, 
# contingent upon how panicked the last few weeks before handin get.
